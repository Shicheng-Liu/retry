Sexual acts are much more meaningful, if that makes any sense, than they were before. \n\nAdditionally, she has a hard time processing the idea that I, at some point, loved and cared for them too in the same way as I care for her now. I tend to be a little \"overly-attached\" at times, so I can't really object to this statement. It is not entirely impossible that I care for her the way I do simply because it's in my nature.\n\nHowever, I am positive that I have never been in love with anyone as I have been with my current girlfriend, and wouldn't want it all to end because of this.

Other opinions?\nPOST: We began dating right after 1st year Uni, dated 1 year then broke up for 6 months over differences in expectations for how long our dating would continue before marriage.\nI lean toward a shorter dating preference (1.5-3yrs) by which point I feel I would have decided on way or the other. She feels more that every other aspect of her life (career, school, family, financials...) must be perfectly in place to accommodate marriage regardless of how long that takes. \n\nAfter getting back together and being more clear that I would be willing to date happily until she felt her life was in order if she was considerate of me not wanting to date just to hold off marriage. and things have been going relatively well since then (3+ years since). We have travelled together, spent family holidays together and always been in open communication about our motivations, opinions, aspirations and disagreements. We have not lived together.\n\nSince 1-2 months ago we have been slowly having more and more difficulty with our depth/frequency of conversation and it is making her very uncertain about our relationships future and how much I care for her.\nI am someone who is very easygoing, patient, I feel loved by just spending quality time (out of the house especially) together a few times per week and doing random acts of kindness. I would only expect to have a thought provoking and deep conversation with my closest friends and family perhaps 1 time per month, and somewhat more with my SO.\nShe is someone who is very critical thinking, loves hugs and being complimented, and is always excited to just sit and talk about anything that comes to mind for a long time as long as the conversation is stimulating.\n\nIt does not, to me, feel like we've been having fewer conversations but she tells me I have been less ready to participate actively and less giving of my time for such conversations. I feel that such an intense level of conversation just isn't sustainable, she feels it's necessary. We plan to attend couples counselling this month for the first time.\n\nIs this normal? Is it a real problem or is one of us being unreasonable? Can anyone relate? I really do love her and want this to work.\nTL;DR:",

I finally decided on the Forerunner 305 since it would do everything I wanted and was a good price (even though it's huge).\n\nBest price I found online was through Amazon for around $130, with free shipping if I wanted to wait 1-2 weeks. It was available at the local Best Buy for $150. Did a quick search and found a printable coupon good for the month of February at Best Buy for 20% off all \"Health & Fitness\" products.\n\nWent in to Best Buy and the price was $160 on the shelf. I found an employee (just happened to be a cute girl) nearby and told her I wanted to get the 305. She said she had that model and loved it...even more than some of the more expensive ones she tried (even though it's huge). She said she has run some marathons and we chatted a little bit about how I was just starting to run. She told me about some of the runs in the area, how the best ones tend to end with beer, and overall was very pleasant and informative while waiting in line at the cashier. I definitely hope to meet more cool people like her while pursuing this sport.\n\nSo I got to the cashier and the 305 rang up at $160 as expected. I mentioned the web site price was $150 and he price matched it. Then I gave him the 20% off coupon and it wouldn't scan. He tried typing in the number and it wouldn't take it. So he tried again and it accepted the coupon, but didn't apply the discount to the 305. He read the coupon, looked at the GPS, manually entered the 20% off and had a supervisor approve it.

We are now back together and met up overseas and travelled for a few weeks then she has a few weeks travelling by herself before she returns home.\n\nI have noticed she keeps in touch with her ex-boyfriends, one in particular, who she has told me a bit about but overall been very closed about it. She is going to his country visit. All she has told me is that she is staying with a \"friend\" there who she met when she lived there. I'm about 90% sure it's him.\n\nMy issue is not that I mind her seeing an ex boyfriend, it's that she is not open about it and still doesn't tell me when I ask her who she is staying with. \n\nWhat is the best way to bring up the fact that this makes me uncomfortable? I am going to try to address this on skype.\nI've tried not to blather on too much but ask if I have forgotten any important details.\nTL;DR:",

She has asked my multiple times and I had curved the question by jokingly saying \"Yeah, only if someone holds my hand.\" And I even said that I'm not really into scary things.\n\nThe truth is that I have trouble coping with large amounts of anxiety and I barely even watch scary movies because of it.\n\nSo about a week ago I said I would go to a haunted house, at my girlfriend's request. Today, the day we were supposed to go, I told her I was nervous and I didn't know if I wanted to go. I told her I wouldn't enjoy the experience because of my anxiety, but I would still go if she wanted to. \n\nMy girlfriend seemed to take me confiding in her more as me letting her down than anything else. She started talking about how I should have said no to begin with, and why did I wait until the last minute to say I would be uncomfortable. \n\nI apologized and said if you really want to go, I will still go, but it just might not be enjoyable for me. She just shut down after this and is continuing to focus on me letting her down. \n\nI then suggested that we should still go out and do something, even if she wants to stay in because I wouldn't be comfortable at the haunted house. She initially rejected my suggestion, but eventually said, \"You plan what we'll do then. I just wanted to do something that we couldn't do any other time of the year. Where could we even go out to dinner that we haven't already been.\" (This is not verbatim, but just the gist of what she said)\n\nI understand I could have communicated more directly when she first brought up the haunted houses a few weeks ago. I take responsibility for that.  \n\nMy question is: What do I do now that my girlfriend is so disappointed that it almost seems like she's depressed? How do I make this into a good night, or is that not possible anymore?\n\nAny additional feedback unrelated to my primary questions is appreciated as well.  Thank you!\nTL;DR:",

Huge chunks of mucus came flying out my nose and onto the bottom of the tub. They were actually so big that I had to intentionally get water to flow onto them to make them move. I got out of the shower, feeling MUCH better with myself, and put my clothes on. As I was downstairs getting the last of my stuff together, I could hear my roommate getting up and walking into the bathroom. I was then serenaded by the lovely sounds of her screaming, \"Oh my f***** god!\" I half-jogged upstairs and saw her standing in the bathroom looking down into the tub. She told me, verbatim, \"Shadowheart321, I know guys have needs, but can you **PLEASE** keep it out of the shower and keep it in your room?\"\n\nI realized when I looked into the tub that we had just gotten a new drain catch and all of my nasty phlegm was stuck in it. I quickly caught on and started telling her that it wasn't what she thought and I was just really sick and I just had to blow my nose and it's not that, etc. She was listening to none of it and was still just staring into the tub with an appalled face on. As I bantered, my other roommate walked into the room to see what the fuss was about, and before I could even try to explain what happened, he looked into the tub and started absolutely hollering. In a last ditch effort to prove to them that it wasn't *that*, I leaned over, stuck my hand into the drain catch and scooped up some of my nasal droppings and told them to take a deep wiff of it. Then both turned out of the bathroom looking queasy as I stood there with a handful of mucus sitting in my palm. I will forever be known as the guy who picked up his own load from the bottom of the shower and told them to smell.\nTL;DR:",

I'm not saying be there every single day but... Maybe shoot me a text or something atleast.  \n\nI feel bad for letting it bother me, and I don't want to feel this way.
